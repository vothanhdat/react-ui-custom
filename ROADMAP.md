# React UI Custom — Roadmap

This repo is already set up as a UI library (Vite build, `vite-plugin-dts`, Storybook). The core pattern is:
- `elFactory()` to create typed components
- `propsToClassNameFactory()` to convert props → CSS classes
- CSS lives in `src/components/css/*` and is pulled by components (currently via `../css/index.css`)

Below is a pragmatic roadmap that keeps you shipping components quickly while tightening quality/publishability over time.

## Phase 0 — Stabilize the foundation (1–2 days)
**Goal:** Make it easy to add components consistently.

- Ensure public exports are coherent
  - Decide the public API surface: export only from `src/index.ts`.
  - Create/maintain `src/components/index.ts` as the single barrel for components.
- Establish component folder conventions
  - `src/components/<ComponentName>/index.tsx`
  - `src/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.stories.tsx`
  - Optional `src/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.test.tsx` (when you start tests)
- Storybook conventions
  - One story per component + variants (color/variant/layout/state)
  - Use `getStoryBookArgTypes()` for props generated by `elFactory`

**Deliverable:** documented conventions + a “component checklist” (see `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

## Phase 1 — Core primitives & utilities (2–5 days)
**Goal:** solidify primitives that every component builds on.

- Core
  - Standardize `className()` usage everywhere (already present).
  - Confirm `propsToClassNameFactory()` behavior for enum props (it currently outputs `${key}-${value}` — this assumes your CSS uses that naming convention).
  - Decide whether to support `data-*` / `aria-*` passthrough (it already passes unknown props through).
- Add the “layout + typography + button” triad as stable
  - `Button` (already)
  - `Section`, `FlexLayout`, `GridLayout` (already)
  - `Typo` (already)

**Deliverable:** stable primitives, consistent naming, and docs for your class naming conventions.

## Phase 2 — Components you’ll use everywhere (1–2 weeks)
**Goal:** ship a “minimum viable UI kit” based on your CSS utilities.

Recommended order (keeps dependencies simple):
- Inputs
  - `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`
  - `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`
- Feedback
  - `Badge`, `Tag`, `Alert`, `Toast` (or minimal `Alert` first)
  - `Spinner` / loading skeleton helpers
- Containers
  - `Card`, `Divider`, `Accordion`
- Navigation
  - `Tabs`, `Breadcrumb`, `Pagination`

For each component:
- Add props → classes via `_base.ts` mappings where possible
- Add CSS only if missing; otherwise reuse existing classes in `src/components/css/*`

**Deliverable:** 10–15 core components with stories.

## Phase 3 — Overlays & complex UI (2–4 weeks)
**Goal:** address accessibility and behavior-heavy components.

- `Modal`, `Drawer`, `Tooltip`, `Dropdown/Menu`
- A11y requirements:
  - Focus trap (Modal/Drawer)
  - Escape key to close
  - ARIA roles and keyboard navigation (Menu/Tooltip)

**Deliverable:** overlay components with keyboard/a11y coverage.

## Phase 4 — Quality, testing, and DX (ongoing)
**Goal:** confidence to ship versions.

- Testing
  - Add `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` for behavior-heavy components
  - Add storybook interaction tests where useful
- Lint/Types
  - Tighten TS settings gradually (no `any` in public types)
- Versioning & publishing
  - Add `changesets` (recommended) or conventional commits
  - Add CI: `yarn lint`, `yarn build`, `yarn build-storybook`
  - Publish to npm (set `private: false`, add `license`, `repository`, `keywords`, etc.)

**Deliverable:** reliable releases + changelog.

## Phase 5 — Theming strategy (optional; only if needed)
**Goal:** support customization without rewriting components.

- Decide: pure CSS class themes vs CSS variables.
- If CSS variables:
  - define tokens in `src/components/css/root.css` and keep components token-driven.

**Deliverable:** multiple themes (light/dark or brand variants).
