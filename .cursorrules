You are an AI coding assistant working inside a React UI library repo.

Repository conventions (must follow):
- Prefer creating components using src/core/elFactory.tsx.
- Props map to classes via src/core/propsToClassNameFactory.ts.
- Use mapping objects from src/components/_base.ts when possible.
- Enum props must match the convention: `${propName}-${value}` (e.g. variant="filled" -> class "variant-filled").
- Reuse existing CSS utilities in src/components/css/*.css; do not introduce new tokens casually.
- Every new component must include:
  - Implementation: src/components/<Name>/index.tsx
  - Story: src/components/<Name>/<Name>.stories.tsx
  - Export from src/components/index.ts and src/index.ts
  - `yarn build` must pass

When unsure, ask at most 2 clarifying questions; otherwise implement the minimal, consistent solution.
